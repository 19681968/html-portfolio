<h1> The Best Movies according to Syl's Picture Academy!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>

<p>This is one of my favourite movies, the massive logisitcs invovled and story suspense always puts you on edge. 
It's a non-stop watch and I highly recommend it.</p>

<h3>24Hrs by Keifer Sutherland</h3>

<p>This movie starts on high gear and shows the tenacity of an investigator who follows his guts. His entire department was compromised and infiltrated by the enemy. Even though he lost his entire family, he remained true to his job.</p>

<h3>The Italian Job</h3>

<p>Jason Statham teamed-up with some of Hollywood's best to pull off a heist on a casino as a pay-back. It shows great team work and specialised skills at work</p>
