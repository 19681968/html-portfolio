<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I fell in love with computers in 2004 at the Don Bosco Polytechnic in Liberia when I escaped the war in my country Sierra Leone.
  Since I was a refugee at that time, I did it with the intention of keeping busy and acquiring a skill to use the worlds greatest working tool.</p>

<p>After the war in 2010 I returned home and secured my first IT job as a software tutor for microsoft office packages and 
  that was the beginning of my computer journey.</p>

<p>Four years later, I then got hired by another company as a audio/visual assistant which was a straight forward job of dealing with podium setup for event and
  content management for their website and facebook page.</p>

<p>I am here now training as a web developer so I can learn to build and manage a website on my own. I hope to take it further 
  and learn other programming languages indept like python and java script. So far its been fun and I look forward to all the challenges ahead.
  I love music, great movies and wish to have two dogs some day....soon maybe.</p>
